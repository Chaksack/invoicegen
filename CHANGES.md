# Changes Made to the Invoice Generator Application

## Google Authentication Implementation

We've enhanced the Invoice Generator application with Google authentication and made it production-ready for deployment on Vercel. Here's a summary of the changes:

### 1. NextAuth.js Integration

- Installed NextAuth.js and the Sequelize adapter
- Created a NextAuth API route at `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts`
- Configured NextAuth.js with Google provider
- Set up callbacks to integrate with our existing authentication system

### 2. User Model Updates

- Updated the User model to support Google authentication:
  - Made the password field optional
  - Added fields for Google authentication (googleId, name, image)
  - Updated the comparePassword method to handle users without passwords
  - Added proper validation and error handling

### 3. Authentication Context Updates

- Updated the AuthContext to integrate with NextAuth.js
- Added a loginWithGoogle method
- Updated the useEffect hook to check for both JWT token and NextAuth.js session
- Updated the logout function to handle both authentication methods

### 4. UI Updates

- Added Google sign-in buttons to the login and register pages
- Styled the buttons to match the application's design
- Added proper loading states and error handling

### 5. Production Readiness

- Updated the Vercel configuration file with all necessary environment variables
- Enhanced the database connection with better error handling and retry logic
- Created comprehensive deployment documentation (VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md)
- Added proper error handling and logging for production environments

## How to Test

1. Set up Google OAuth credentials following the instructions in VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md
2. Update your .env file with the Google OAuth credentials
3. Run the application locally:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Test the Google authentication flow:
   - Click the "Sign in with Google" button on the login or register page
   - Authorize the application
   - Verify that you're redirected back to the application and logged in

## How to Deploy

Follow the detailed instructions in VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md to deploy the application to Vercel. The document includes:

1. Prerequisites for deployment
2. Step-by-step instructions for setting up Google OAuth credentials
3. Options for setting up a PostgreSQL database
4. Detailed deployment instructions using both Vercel CLI and Vercel Dashboard
5. Instructions for setting up environment variables

## Next Steps

After deploying the application, consider implementing these additional features:

1. Email verification for users who register with email and password
2. Password reset functionality
3. Additional social login providers (e.g., GitHub, Facebook)
4. Enhanced security measures (e.g., rate limiting, CSRF protection)
5. Analytics to track user engagement
6. Improved error reporting with services like Sentry
